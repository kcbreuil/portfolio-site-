            Hi! I'm Katie. I am a Miami-based web developer, designer and
            educator. I graduated from Florida State University with a B.A. in
            Creative Writing. I came to the tech world with a background in
            events, marketing and communications in the art industry. When I'm
            not talking code, I am cuddling with my pets, working out, or
            sipping a delicious-iced-caffeinated beverage, in no specific order.
