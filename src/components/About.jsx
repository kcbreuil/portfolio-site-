        Born in the county of dade, I came to tech with a passion for connecting
        people and an eye for clean design. I graduated from Florida State
        University in 2011 with a B.A. in Creative Writing. When I'm not coding,
        you can find me snuggling my two cats and chihuahua, Tico, that I
        adopted from a Family Dollar parking lot, getting stretchy on my yoga
        mat, or watching a Disney movie I've already seen 347 times.
